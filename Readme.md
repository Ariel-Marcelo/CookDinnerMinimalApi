# RESTful API with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs

Description: Develop a simple RESTful API for managing a resource (e.g., a product catalog, blog posts, or a to-do list).

Technologies and Concepts:

- .NET 8: Utilize the latest features.
- Minimal APIs: Build lightweight APIs with minimal overhead.
- Options & Configurations: Use IOptions pattern for app settings.
- Middleware: Implement custom middleware for logging or exception handling.
- Constraints: Apply route and model validation constraints.
- Serilog: Integrate for structured logging.
- Testing with XUnit: Write unit and integration tests.
- Docker: Containerize the application.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Automate build and test processes.
- Data Structures and Algorithms: Efficiently handle data within the API.
- Fake Data Generators: Use for testing purposes.
